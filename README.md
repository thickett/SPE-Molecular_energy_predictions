# SPE-Molecular_energy_predictions

I have made a single notebook that is fairly fast to run through, it outlines how you can use Pyspark, and hadoop's HDFS to create highly scalable, lightning fast ML pipelines that are fit for very large scale pipelines. I also go through some details on Hyperopt and how to paralize non parallelizable libraries in the ML space.

To show this we build a ML pipeline useing the already described technologies to estimate SPE energies of a large variation of molecules.
